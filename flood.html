            <h1>Low Risk</h1>
             <p>Cicsterns and rain barrels capture stormwater 
                 <br> runoff from roofs. Rain barrels can retain around 50 gallons.
                 Cisterns retain hundreds to thousands of gallons of water.</p>
            <p> 
                Rain barrels cost between $90 and $140 and cisterns cost up to $1000. 
                Some areas offer rebate programsfor rain barrels and <br>  cisterns so be 
                sure to check your local government site to see if you qualify.

            <h1>Medium Risk</h1>
             <p>Permeable pavement is a type of pavement that is highly pervious and allows rainwater to pass through it, 
                 which reduces runoff. By reducing runoff, permeable pavement manages stormwater and decreases flood risk. 
                 Permeable pavement can be used for your propertyâ€™s road, driveway, patio, or swimming pool deck. 
                 <p>The cost of permeable pavement depends on the material you use but tends to range from $5 - $10 per square foot. 
                  Permeable pavement can be built to hold anywhere from 5 to 19 gallons of rainwater per minute.

                A sump pump is a personal solution to flooding in a home. 
                Sump pumps work to move water out of a basement and into a designated drainage area.
                There are four kinds of sump pumps: submersible, pedestal, 
                battery-operated backup, and water-powered backup.  
             </p>
             <p>
                Generally, sump pumps cost anywhere from $100 to $400 but there are other 
                considerations that could add to the price of installing a sump pump.
